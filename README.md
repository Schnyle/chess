# chess

## need to do
- deployment stuff got messed up I guess - signup page not found and db not seeding with Render db

## could do
- improve "Don't have an account?" text on Login page - currently jumps to two lines often
- choose board color
- sounds
- see if pawn promotion opening check needs more logic
- replace implementations of util.fen_to_list() with util.fen_to_dict()
- choose piece to promote to (modal)
- update Active Games with state
