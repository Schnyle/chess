## things i need to do
- error messages at login/signup (formik?)
- in Profile.js, set profileData using users data instead of making additional fetch
- add white/black king icons to Completed Games section

## things i could do
- improve "Don't have an account?" text on Login page - currently jumps to two lines often
- improve animation area of CardActionArea - animation area currently larger than it should be
