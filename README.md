## things i need to do
- error messages at login/signup (formik?)

## things i could do
- improve "Don't have an account?" text on Login page - currently jumps to two lines often
- improve animation area of CardActionArea - animation area currently larger than it should be
- find better way to update page when switching from one user page to another. Currently needs forced refresh
- fix text next to profile image on profile page. Currently will be centered until image loads
